SlothiestLoader is a responsive and retina-aware lazy loader.

It is a fork of [LaziestLoader](http://sjwilliams.github.io/laziestloader/) by Josh Williams, with the main difference that it doesn't depend on jQuery. Everything else, from necessary markup to features, should be the same. "Should", because it wasn't thoroughly tested yet.
